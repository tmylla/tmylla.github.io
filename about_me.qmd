::: {#hero-heading}

:::

I am a statistician, R developer and part-time lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo. Over the past few years, I've become very interested in **research software, open source** and **data science** practices in education and public sector.


My **interests** are: 

* Real World Data (RWD), in particular Electronic Health Records (EHR) data,
* Statistical software development in public health and clinical research,
* Statistics education with open source tools,
* Quarto.


I have a MSc in Statistics from Imperial College London in 2016. Then I moved to Norway to do my PhD and some [hiking](misc info/photo3_chi.jpg). I obtained my PhD (thesis: *Representation and Utilization of hospital Electronic Health Records data*) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo in 2022.

Shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, I joined [Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/) as a **data scientist** (R developer + statistician) for the open source real-time analysis and public health surveillance system, Sykdomspulsen (now [CSIDS](https://www.csids.no)). I am one of a founding members of CSIDS, the Consortium for Statistics in Disease Surveillance, where we build open source software for public health surveillance. 

Sometimes I teach **statistics** courses (MF9130, MF9130E, ERN4110) at Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology ([OCBE](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/research/centres/ocbe/)), University of Oslo. As a certified Carpentries instructor, I also teach and help with **R programming** at the [Carpentries workshops](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/carpentry-uio/) at University of Oslo. In 2023, I lead the transition of medical statistics classroom of MF9130E into open-source ([read more](https://andreaczhang.github.io/blog/blog_20230717_teaching/)).


I am an active member of Oslo User R group and Oslo R ladies group. I give talks and host workshops to learn and share.

In the past 11 years I have lived in the UK and Norway (7+ years). I speak English, Norwegian and Chinese, and trying to learn Italian. I like outdoor activities, and most likely I am spending my summer in the mountains.
