I started teaching introductory statistics at Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo since early 2023. I aim to make basic data skills and statistics accessible to health researchers, by combining modern data science tools (R, quarto, version control) with hands-on practice in my class.

In my free time I volunteer in the Carpentries workshops to teach Rstats to researchers and students at UiO.
