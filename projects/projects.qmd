### Open source projects in AI4Good

I develop open source projects exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and social good. My work spans AI Safety research, AI Psychology, and interpretability toolkits for the research community.

I'm also a co-lead of the [PACEbench](https://pacebench.github.io/) project, a framework for evaluating AI cyber-exploitation capabilities.
