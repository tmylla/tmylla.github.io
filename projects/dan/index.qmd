(This is my own note-taking system using quarto)

### About the notes

[Data Apothecary's Notes](https://andreaczhang.github.io/data-apothecary-notes/) is a note-taking repository for modern data science skills with a focus on **drug development and clinical trials**. Content will be gradually added while I learn the topics. Therefore, it is by no means a complete guide by the time you read it!

I try to organize the content in a modular way. I think these should cover the important aspects in which a data scientist / modern statistician should know.

* study design
* inference
* models
* reporting
* programming


### Why quarto

In short, quarto has the advantage of making a very well structured website with code chunks easy. No more worry about scattered notes in different folders - put them together, render it so you can find your notes quickly!
