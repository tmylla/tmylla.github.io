::: {#hero-heading}

Hello!

I am a researcher at **Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory**, working on AI Safety, frontier risks, interpretability, and AI + Social Science.

I received my Ph.D. in Cybersecurity from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2021-2025).

I am a firm believer in **human-AI symbiosis**.

My life philosophy: *"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference."*

I am also a **science fiction enthusiast**.
