::: {#hero-heading}

Hello! 

I am a data scientist at **Roche**, working on clinical data science and open source software in pharma: [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org).

I'm building [Data Apothecary's Notes](https://chizapoth.github.io/data-apothecary-notes/), a series of notes on modern data science skills for **drug development and clinical trials**.

Previously, I worked in **public health and academia** in Norway (2019-2024). See [Archive](projects/projects.qmd) for past projects.

I enjoy cooking and spending time in the mountains.
