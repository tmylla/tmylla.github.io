::: {#hero-heading}

:::

I am a researcher at **Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory**, working on clinical data science and open source software in the pharmaceutical industry. I am passionate about **AI Safety, frontier risks, interpretability, and AI + Social Science**.

My **research interests** are:

* AI Safety and frontier risks,
* Interpretability and explainable AI,
* AI applications in social science,
* Cybersecurity.

I received my Ph.D. in Cybersecurity from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2021-2025).

I am a firm believer in **human-AI symbiosis** — the idea that humans and AI can work together to achieve greater outcomes.

Outside of research, I am a **science fiction enthusiast** and enjoy exploring ideas about the future of technology and humanity.
