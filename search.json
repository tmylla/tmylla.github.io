    "section": "About the topic",
    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"

Since 2016, She has been working with Real World Data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and large public health registries. In 2020-2022 she worked as part of the COVID emergency response team at Norwegian Institute of Public Health to develop an open source real-time analysis and public health surveillance system. At the moment Chi is collaborating with Oslo University Hospital and Akershus University Hospital on understanding antibiotics prescription and usage recorded in the EHR system. She develops R packages to facilitate exploration of messy EHR data. Outside research and R package development, She teaches statistics courses using R and Quarto. Chi is a Co-lead of the CAMIS project (Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software) and has contributed to various chapters to RWD Guideline for Programming and Analysis Processes."
