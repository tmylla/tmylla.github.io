::: {#hero-heading}

:::

I am a data scientist at **Roche**, working on clinical data science and open source software in the pharmaceutical industry. I am passionate about **R programming, open source** and **data science** practices in healthcare.

My **interests** are: 

* Clinical data science and statistical programming in pharma,
* Real World Data (RWD), in particular Electronic Health Records (EHR) data,
* Quarto.

Previously, I worked in public health and academia in Norway (2019-2024). See [Archive](projects/projects.qmd) for past projects and teaching.

I speak Chinese mandarin, English, Italian and Norwegian. Outside of work, I enjoy [hiking](misc/info/photo3_chi.jpg) and spending time in the mountains.
